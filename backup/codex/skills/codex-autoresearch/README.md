The idea: tell Codex what you want to improve, then walk away. It modifies your code, verifies the result, keeps or discards, and repeats. You come back to a log of experiments and a better codebase.

Inspired by [Karpathy's autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch), generalized beyond ML to anything you can verify mechanically: test coverage, type errors, latency, lint warnings, security findings, release readiness — if a command can tell whether it improved, the loop can iterate on it.

## Quick Start

```text
# Install in Codex (recommended)
$skill-installer install https://github.com/leo-lilinxiao/codex-autoresearch
```

Restart Codex, open your project, and go:

```
You:   $codex-autoresearch
       I want to get rid of all the `any` types in my TypeScript code

Codex: I found 47 `any` occurrences across src/**/*.ts.
       Metric: `any` count (current: 47), direction: lower
       Verify: grep count + tsc --noEmit as guard
       Run mode: foreground or background?

You:   Background, go. Run overnight.

Codex: Starting background run — baseline: 47. Iterating.
```

Each improvement stacks. Each failure reverts. Everything is logged.

See [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for manual copy, symlink, and user-scope options. See [GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md) for the full manual.

## How It Works

```
You say one sentence  →  Codex scans & confirms  →  You say "go"
                                                        |
                                         +--------------+--------------+
                                         |                             |
                                    foreground                    background
                                  (current session)            (detached, overnight)
                                         |                             |
                                         +--------------+--------------+
                                                        |
                                                        v
                                              +-------------------+
                                              |    The Loop       |
                                              |                   |
                                              |  modify one thing |
                                              |  git commit       |
                                              |  run verify       |
                                              |  improved? keep   |
                                              |  worse? revert    |
                                              |  log the result   |
                                              |  repeat           |
                                              +-------------------+
```

That's it. You pick one: foreground keeps the loop in your current session, background hands it off to a detached process so you can sleep. Same loop either way, but they don't run at the same time.

## What You Say vs What Happens

| You say | What happens |
|---------|-------------|
| "Improve my test coverage" | Iterates until target or interrupted |
| "Fix the 12 failing tests" | Repairs one by one until zero remain |
| "Why is the API returning 503?" | Hunts root cause with falsifiable hypotheses |
| "Is this code secure?" | STRIDE + OWASP audit, every finding backed by code evidence |
| "Ship it" | Verifies readiness, generates checklist, gates release |
| "I want to optimize but don't know what" | Analyzes repo, suggests metrics, generates config |

Behind the scenes, Codex maps your sentence to one of 7 modes (loop, plan, debug, fix, security, ship, exec). You never need to pick one.

## What Codex Figures Out

You don't write config. Codex infers everything from your sentence and your repo:

| What it needs | How it gets it | Example |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Goal | Your sentence | "get rid of all any types" |
| Scope | Scans repo structure | `src/**/*.ts` |
| Metric | Proposes based on goal + tooling | any count (current: 47) |
| Direction | Infers from "improve" / "reduce" / "eliminate" | lower |
| Verify | Matches to repo tooling | `grep` count + `tsc --noEmit` |
| Guard | Suggests if regression risk exists | `npm test` |

Before starting, Codex always shows what it found and asks you to confirm. Then you choose foreground or background and say "go."

## When It Gets Stuck

Instead of blind retrying, the loop escalates:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| 3 consecutive failures | **REFINE** — adjust within current strategy |
| 5 consecutive failures | **PIVOT** — try a fundamentally different approach |
| 2 PIVOTs without progress | **Web search** — look for external solutions |
| 3 PIVOTs without progress | **Stop** — report that human input is needed |

One success resets all counters.

## Results Log

Every iteration is recorded in the workspace Results directory at `autoresearch-results/results.tsv`:

```
iteration  commit   metric  delta   status    description
0          a1b2c3d  47      0       baseline  initial any count
1          b2c3d4e  41      -6      keep      replace any in auth module
2          -        49      +8      discard   generic wrapper introduced new anys
3          d4e5f6g  38      -3      keep      type-narrow API response handlers
```

Failed experiments revert from git but stay in the log. The log is the real audit trail, while `autoresearch-results/state.json` is the resume snapshot.

## More Features

These are covered in detail in [GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md):

- **Cross-run learning** — lessons from past runs bias future hypothesis generation
- **Parallel experiments** — test up to 3 hypotheses simultaneously via git worktrees
- **Session resume** — interrupted runs pick up from the last consistent state
- **CI/CD mode** (`exec`) — non-interactive, JSON output, for automation pipelines
- **Dual-gate verification** — separate verify (did it improve?) and guard (did anything break?)
- **Session hooks** — auto-installed; keep Codex on track across session boundaries

## FAQ

**It only makes small incremental changes. Can it try bigger ideas?**
By default the loop favors small, verifiable steps — that's by design. But it can go bigger: describe a larger hypothesis in your prompt (e.g., "try replacing the attention mechanism with linear attention and run the full eval"), and it will treat that as a single experiment to verify. The loop is best when the human sets the research direction and the agent does the heavy execution and analysis.

**Is this more for engineering optimization than research?**
It's strongest when the goal and metric are clear — push coverage up, push errors down, push latency lower. For open-ended research where the direction itself is uncertain, use `plan` mode first to explore, then switch to `loop` once you know what to measure. Think of it as a human-AI collaboration: you provide judgment, it provides iteration speed.

**How do I stop it?** Foreground: interrupt Codex. Background: `$codex-autoresearch` then ask to stop.

**Can it resume after interruption?** Yes. It resumes from `autoresearch-results/state.json` automatically.

**How do I use it in CI?** `Mode: exec` with `codex exec`. All config upfront, JSON output, exit codes 0/1/2.
